= Introduction =
Orcale Coherence has very powerful ability to create secondary indexes for any attribute of cached objects. While being quite powerful by themselves, standard Coherence indexes have their limitation. Two most important of them are:
 * memory consumption of build in indexes cannot be controlled (and they are [http://blog.griddynamics.com/2009/10/coherence-memory-usage-indexes.html heap hungry] indeed);
 * only hash table or binary tree implementations are available.
Coherence 3.6 has introduced a new API which allows developers to overcome these limitations by plugging in custom implementations for secondary indexes into Coherence caches. Index API opens a way for integrating full-text and other specialized indexes for your distributed caches.

= Project goals =
Coherence custom index API is quite complicated to deal with. The purpose of this project is to implement some generic layer to simplify integration of custom indexes and to adapt widely used search libraries (like [http://lucene.apache.org Apache Lucene]) to be used with Coherence.

== Advantages of Lucene index over built in Coherence index ==
 * Full text search with various query types
 * Better handling of high cardinality indexes ([LuceneForHighCardinalityIndexes read more])
 * Compact index size ([LuceneVsCoherenceMemoryUsage read mode])

== Advantages of integration search using coherence ==
 * Coherence will keep your index in sych with your data
 * In case of distributed cache, custom cache also gets distributed and will benefit from Coherence advanced parallel queering
 * Combine built in Coherence filters with custom ones to make Coherence filter API even more powerful

== Limitation of Coherence search ==
 * Coherence Filter API is very basic, so advanced features of search libraries like scoring cannot be exposed. If you need scoring, faceted search, etc then Grid Search is not your choice so far.
