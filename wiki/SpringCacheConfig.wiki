#summary Configuring Coherence caches from Spring context

= Introduction =
== Problem description ==
TODO
== Approach ==
We are going to use custom namespace in Spring to allow Coherence specific elements inside cache config and custom ConfigurableCacheFactory which will use Spring AC instead of {{{cache-config.xml}}}.
== Goals (acceptance criteria) ==
 * get rid of {{{cache-config.xml}}} without loosing functionality
 * define services, schemes and caches as beans in spring
 * use Spring IoC for coherence plugins such as {{{CacheStore}}} or {{{MapListeners}}}
 * allow to configure cache indexes at configuration level (in Spring context file)
 * allow to easily switch schema for cache using property (e.g. force all caches to use local  schema by single property)

= Details =

All logical configuration elements will be separate Spring beans with custom schema similar to {{{cache-config.xml}}}. Logical elements are
 * cache definition
 * cache schema definition (may be inlined to cache definition)
 * cache service definition (distributed/replicated/near/local ...)
 * backing map / local cache definition

Technically spring bean will be just a fragments of xml configuration.

There will be single {{{CacheFactory}}} bean (which will also install itself as {{{CacheFactory}}} for Coherence).

No direct access to {{{CacheFactory}}} from code should be used.

There are 2 scenarios how {{{NamedCache}}} could be initialized.
===Initializing {{{NamedCache}}} bean in context===
{{{NamedCache}}} bean will have all required configuration pieces provided by Spring as dependencies. In {{{afterPropertiesSet}}} method {{{NamedCache}}} bean will access {{{CacheFactory}}} bean (which is also should be injected). {{{NamedCache}}} bean will provided required xml pieces to factory and it will create Coherence {{{NamedCache}}} instance.
===Initializing {{{NamedCache}}} by {{{CacheService}}}===
When cache is created on single Coherence node, cache services from other nodes will automatically try to create a cache with same name (in particular distributed cache will be initialized simultaniously on all nodes). When request for cache creation comes from Coherence itself, {{{SpringCacheFactory}}} should lookup bean with same name in Spring AC (there should be naming convention for {{{NamedCache}}} beans and corresponding Coherence caches). {{{SpringCacheFactory}}} will accure {{{NamedCache}}} bean with all its configration and will be able to create Coherence cache instance.
