#summary Data loss listener for Coherence.
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

Its a rare but possible situation, when data stored in Coherence cluster is lost (due to hardware fault, network partitioning, or even software bug). 
Since Coherence version 3.3, there is a PARTITION_LOST event type declared in com.tangosol.net.partition.!PartitionEvent class, and corresponding !PartiotionListener may be implemented. However, stability of this solution is not proven yet, and we decided to implement custom, version-independent and 100% reliable solution here in !GridDynamics Coherence team.

= Solution =

All distributed data within Oracle Coherence grid is stored, replicated, and rebalanced among cluster nodes in partitions. Number of partitions may vary, depending on implicit application settings.
That's why one cannot lose a separate key in the cluster - minimal loss is a whole cache partition.

Proposed solution consists of a special marker cache, called "canary"-cache (Â©Alexey Ragozin), and a !PartitionListener implementation, listening for partition movement events (as of Coherence 3.6.1, these include PARTITION_LOST, PARTITION_TRANSMIT_ROLLBACK and PARTITION_TRANSMIT_COMMIT) and checking "canary" cache size. Cache contains exactly _partitionNumber_ entries, one per partition. Other said, each cache partition contains one and only one "canary" cache entry.

If some cluster nodes crash or other way become inaccessible, tearing down both primary and backup copies of particular cache partitions, these partitions are considered lost. "Canary" cache size reduced by the number of partitions lost, and listener detects data loss. This solution does not depend on deployed Coherence version, does not bring significant overhead due to asynchronous implementation, and enables custom, application-provided recovery or stopping logic.

= Source code and documentation =

Both jar-files, javadocs and source code are available via maven:

{{{
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.gridkit.coherence-tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>coherence-dataloss-listener</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.0</version>
</dependency>
}}}

Don't forget to add [MavenRepo GridKit Maven Repository] to your parent POM to get this dependency properly resolved.
