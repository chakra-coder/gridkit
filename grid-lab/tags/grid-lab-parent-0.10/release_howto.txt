1. Add gridkit-repo to <servers> section of your local settings.xml at USER_HOME/.m2

	<server>
		<id>gridkit-repo.googlecode.com</id>
		<username>malexejev</username>
		<password>*********</password>
	</server>

2. Perform release-prepare on some child project

	mvn release:prepare -Dusername=malexejev -Dpassword=*********
	
3. Perform release-perform on that child project

	mvn release:perform -Dusername=malexejev -Dpassword=*********

Note that it is required to give your credentials in two places (settings.xml and in mvn command itself).
If any upload error happens on steps 2-3 (for example, Google Code likes to return HTTP 50x sometimes) - just rerun command as is. 
Release plugin keeps temporary log of already performed steps.
